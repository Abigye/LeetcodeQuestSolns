# LeetcodeQuestSolns

A  personal collection of LeetCode solutions in Python, organized by **problem-solving patterns**.

An ongoing attempt to strengthen understanding of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** along with their **time and space complexities**.

## ðŸ“š Patterns To Learn & Solve (in no particular order)
- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Fast & Slow Pointers (Tortoise and Hare)
- Prefix Sum
- Binary Search
- DFS & Backtracking
- BFS
- Dynamic Programming
- Hash Maps & Sets
- Greedy
- Graph Traversal
- Topological Sort
- Tries
- Heaps / Priority Queues
- Trees
- LinkedLists


## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Develop strong pattern recognition
- Practice explaining trade-offs and complexities
- Build a personal reference for future interviews
